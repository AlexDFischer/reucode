Use the point2vtk program to visualize the graph from the files produced by the WriteLinks program. An example command:

./point2vtk 0.5 < cntflarge_intlinks.txt > cntflarge_intlinks.vtk && ./point2vtk 0.5 < cntflarge_extlinks.txt > cntflarge_extlinks.vtk && ./point2vtk 1.5 < cntflarge_endpoints.txt > cntflarge_endpoints.vtk && ./point2vtk 1.5 < cntflarge_intbpoints.txt > cntflarge_intbpoints.vtk && ./point2vtk 1.5 < cntflarge_extbpoints.txt > cntflarge_extbpoints.vtk
